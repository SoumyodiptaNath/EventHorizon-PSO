# Event Horizon: Event-Triggered PID Tuning with PSO

This project demonstrates an intelligent control strategy where a path-following robot is optimized using **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**.

The simulation, built with PyGame, showcases how PSO can discover the optimal PID gains and, more importantly, an **event-triggering threshold**. This allows the robot to operate efficiently, updating its control signals only when necessary, rather than at every fixed time interval. The result is a robust and resource-conscious control system.



## 🌟 Key Features

-   **Particle Swarm Optimization**: Intelligently searches for the best PID gains (`Kp`, `Ki`, `Kd`) and the event-triggering threshold.
-   **Event-Triggered Control (ETC)**: Reduces unnecessary control updates, saving computational resources compared to traditional time-triggered systems.
-   **Dynamic Path Generation**: The robot follows a complex, unpredictable path generated using Perlin Noise.
-   **PyGame Simulation**: Provides a clear and interactive visualization of the bot's behavior and the learning process.

## 🤖 See it in Action

Watch as the PSO algorithm refines the control parameters over generations, teaching the bot to follow the path with increasing precision.

**ETC vs. Traditional Control**
Notice how the Event-Triggered bot (right) achieves the same performance as the Time-Triggered bot (left) but with significantly fewer control updates (indicated by the red flashes).

## 🔧 Configuration

All key parameters for the simulation, the bot, and the PSO algorithm are centralized in `SOURCE/utilities.py`. You can modify them directly in the file to experiment with different behaviors.

#### Pygame Simulation Parameters (`game_params`)

  - `y_screen`: Height of the simulation window.
  - `bot_radius`: Visual size of the bot.
  - `Q`: Weighting matrix for determining ETC triggers.
  - `dt`: Simulation time step duration.

#### PSO Member Parameters (`etc_pso_params`)

  - `dt`: Time step for the individual bot simulation.
  - `init_guess`: Central values for the initial random swarm positions (PID gains, Threshold).
  - `max_iter`: Maximum simulation steps for a single bot's evaluation.
  - `range_var`: The spread around `init_guess` for initial particle positions.
  - `Q_err`: Weighting matrix for calculating the bot's path deviation error.

#### PSO Algorithm Parameters (`pso_params`)

  - `num_bots`: The number of particles (bots) in the swarm.
  - `learning_rate`: Cognitive and social learning rates (`c1`, `c2`).
